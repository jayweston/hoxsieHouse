<div>Here's what we did for dinner. We brought mashed potatoes with the milk and butter already measured out in tupperware. Gravy packet , can of corn and a can of chicken. We cooked the gravy in a pot and the potatoes in another pot. Once the potatoes were done we added in about 1/2 of the can of corn and all the chicken. It was so delicious and tasted like a homemade meal. It was nice not to have to eat fast food.</div>

<div>&nbsp;We didnt have too much planned for after dinner so we found a mall in St. George where we thought a dollar theater was. I found a DI. We eventually found the movie theater so we saw a movie and then I saw Freddy's! This restarant was in AZ and I ate there once before I moved. I treated Tony to ice cream and fries - they are so skinny! Love them. I am happy to say that Tony enjoyed eating here. Woot!</div>
