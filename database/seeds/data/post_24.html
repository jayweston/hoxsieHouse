Sunday morning we slept in a bit which was super nice considering how well we slept the night before and then headed off towards Gunlock because it was not far from where we had been staying. 

The reflection on the water is so pretty here

I loved the color on the trees - so green!

We just drove through and didn't really stop but click here for the Gunlock State Park website. If you click "Activities" there is actually quite a lot to do there and in the area - even in the winter! I was surprised and impressed.
