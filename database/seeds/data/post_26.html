We were leaving the area where we had hiked (in the previous post)

and were resting our tired bodies in the car as we drove and then I saw another hike we could do that was pretty short. So we jumped out of the car again

I found a pretty cool jumping spot

And this super cool hole in the rock I could stick my face in

We walked around a bit, there were lots of trails but eventually we came to what 

you see abovecalled Pioneer Names. A few names of pioneers were written up there. 

Pretty cool

Tony opted to take a rest

Not zooming in

Then zooming in

Had to take a panoramic shot and get Tony's leg in there. Whoops!

Reflections and thinking about how I am ready for dinner!
