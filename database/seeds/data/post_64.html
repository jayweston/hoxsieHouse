One of my trips to Utah (the wknd of June 20th) Tony and I went to Timpanogos Cave and hiked to the top and then got to tour the cave as well. It was pretty freekin cool and the walking sticks helped A LOT!</td>

the people in front of us kept taking pix of them posing in the cave and tony &amp; i were the last in the group and had to shut doors behind us so it was getting annoying waiting for this couple so the I decided that  wanted a pic in the cave and thsi is the shot tony got. Lol</td>

my treat at the end was an ice cream cone for not complaining about the hike (which I might or might not tend to do sometimes)</td>
