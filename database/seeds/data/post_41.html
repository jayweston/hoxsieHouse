Checking out Golden Spike National Monument in Utah

So excited to be here, it was our first time being able to go.

Made sure to put a stamp in our passport book

Pretty amazing , 10 miles in one day was a record for them

I wanted to go to Sacramento when I saw this sign. Only 690 miles away - hehe

Miniature replica of the exciting day the railroads met

Tony liked what this said so much when I read it to him. We laughed so much. It says,

"Irish workers wrote a song

about their work with

explosives like black powder and nitroglycerin:

Last week a premature blast went off,

And a mile in the sky went big Jim Goff.

Now when next pay day came around,

Jim Goff a dollar short was found.

He asked the reason; came this reply,

You were docked for the time you were up in the sky."
