Tony & I have missed Salina for the last year or two due to other obligations happening the same weekend as this awesome event but this year we were able to make it back! I'll probably split this up into a few posts because there are quite a few pictures I want to share here.

These are a mix of pictures from Saturday morning and Sunday morning

Stay tuned for more pictures and more about our weekend!
