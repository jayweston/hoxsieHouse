Saturday in San Francisco we were able to check out this cool historical park!

You can see all the pictures I took while we were there. Got a lot!

First we had to make a pressed penny. My brother Evan and I had a fun time doing this all over the place.

It was so fun exploring this historical park and being able to walk up, own and all around on these ships. We got another stamp in our National Parks passport book which was cool
