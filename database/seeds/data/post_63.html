After the hot air balloon ride (June 20th ) and getting engaged, we headed down to Moab area!

Stopped along the way ....A big dinosaur print?

pretty scenery never disappoints

spray painted white where some dinosaur tracks were on the rock

kinda cool to see. Also saw some hieroglyphs or something
