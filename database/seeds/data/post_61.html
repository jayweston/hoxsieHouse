<div>We were super hot of course after hiking to Delicate Arch and decided to find a waterfall spot. The guy at the Visitor's Center said there was no water around but thank goodness for internet on my phone because this wasnt too far away!</div>
<div>Tony crossed to the other side but I was afraid to cross because the water was moving fast</div>
<div>LOL me posing in front of the falls. Putting my foot in , the water was ICY!</div>
<div>Since the water at the falls was WAY COLD we opted for floats from Wendy's and a scenic drive before heading back to SLC</div>
