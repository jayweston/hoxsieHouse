We were super hot of course after hiking to Delicate Arch and decided to find a waterfall spot. The guy at the Visitor's Center said there was no water around but thank goodness for internet on my phone because this wasnt too far away!

Tony crossed to the other side but I was afraid to cross because the water was moving fast

LOL me posing in front of the falls. Putting my foot in , the water was ICY!

Since the water at the falls was WAY COLD we opted for floats from Wendy's and a scenic drive before heading back to SLC
