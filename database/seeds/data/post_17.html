It's that time of year again! I was so excited that this event wasnt canceled since it's a tradition for Tony & I to attend the Eyes to the Sky hot air balloon event in Salina, UT ever since we got engaged there in 2010. 

This year our friends Heidi & Andrew were able to join us which was pretty cool to be able to share the event with some friends.

We left Friday evening, a little later than planned but after picking up our friends in Lehi we headed towards Salina which was less than 2 hours away. We filled up with gas and got some good eats at Wendy's and found our campsite. We had talked about going to the Manti temple pageant but we will save that for another time. At the campsite we collected some firewood, got settled and made some s'mores. 

The next morning we were up early to head into town for the balloon launch.

We went back to our camping spot after the balloons launched and Andrew made everyone pancakes. They were so delicious!

After eating we headed out to Fremont Indian State Park and also found a Walmart in Richfield because I had 2 lights that went out on my car and somehow Tony & I both forgot to bring the eggs for omlettes. Whoops!
