in the gift shop of the museum

in the place that people built so long ago. it smelled gross in there

flying ants (that were <strong>RED</strong>!) were the thing I was most scared of. I had just stomped on one and i was afraid it might still be alive under my sandal. ahh ha ha

a shot looking the other direction

This place is located an hour and a half or so from Mesa
