Driving back to SLC from a weekend adventure in southern Utah

Apparently there is a lot to do here. Next time we are driving by I want to stop and stay longer

Here's the website with information

And we found a hole in a rock

Sadly the trash can hasnt been emptied for a long time.

Just keeping it real.

Here's a better picture with that trash cropped out. Would have been fun if we had had time to hike up to the window

Such a pretty area

Goodbye, Hole in the rock
