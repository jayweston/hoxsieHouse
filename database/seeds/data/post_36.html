Too windy for the balloons to inflate :( but we got a nice show of fire instead. Nice for me because we came straight from the museum in Delta back to Main Street in Salina so I had no time to change or grab a jacket. 

The fire was so warm

Having fun during the ..fire glow? Still a little sad no balloon glow

This guy doesnt have a basket - just a lawn chair! He actually goes up in the air like that! Pretty amazing I think.
