The drive to Pinedale sure was pretty!

We went to the Mountain Man museum but it was $7/person and they closed in 45 minutes. Nevermind that! We walked around outside and admired the teepees.

We went to a grocery store and walked around and then there was a hardware store next door so we walked around there as well to see what we could see. I thought this "Invisible Glove" stuff was pretty funny. Should have gotten it for a white elephant gift exchange! Oh man. 

As we were leaving town to drive back to the campsite, Tony & I saw this huge owl painted on the side of a building by a park. You bet I made Tony turn around and get out with me for a picture. Ahh I love it!
