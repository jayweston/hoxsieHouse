Ate at the Hot Spot for dinner in Salina on Friday night

I liked this sign/decal on the side of their building that I saw as we waited for our food- 

"Ok toots..." LOL

Shared a strawberry banana shake with Tony. So big and super delicious. One of the best I have had lately

My hamburger. Also tasted really great , no complaints

Sunset on Friday evening as we drove to our camp site. Looked cooler in person but I had to try to capture it.

Last time we camped at this particular spot there was a dead cow. 

Pretty gross.

This time we encountered these crazy ant hills. Tried to not camp by them and things went okay.

Picking our camping spot!
