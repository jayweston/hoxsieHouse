A few Sundays ago the weather was so nice outside that we decided to go for a hike up in Little Cottonwood Canyon.

We encountered a few other people on the trail but no a ton. Mostly we had to watch out for the bikers who were racing on the paths.

These seemed like fall colors but nope, it is for spring!

We mostly hiked along the stream but sometimes the path went a bit away 

from it

Sideways pic but this was a heart shaped rock I found

So glad we could spend some time together up in the mountains enjoying nature!
