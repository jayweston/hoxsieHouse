On our way to Fremont Indian State Park, it was a pretty drive.

Cool rocks to look at as we got close to the visitors center

We started out here and watched a video about the area, walked around the 

gift shop and museum.

Then we went outside for a short walk around the center. There are many trails to hike in the area but because of time limits we just did one. We were given a free map to follow the signs on the trails and read about different rock art.

Checking out the pit house

This is a fun place for families to explore and there is a good section in the visitors center for kids with different hands on activities.

It's $6/vehicle to get in 

There is camping available in the park for $13/night
