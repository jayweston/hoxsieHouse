Tony and I went to Goblin Valley. I've wanted to go here ever since he told me about it and it was so fantastic to be able to actually make the trip!

Happy face!

Hooray for that view!

Cool pattern on one of the rocks I saw

Tony was having fun taking pictures of me ...hehe

Riding like a horse. Ha!

It was a beautiful day

Cant wait to go here again someday, so worth the trip!
