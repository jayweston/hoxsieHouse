<div>Tony sent me an email that I got one day at work and it made me so excited inside! It was some trips he was thinking about doing , trips to do together, pretty much from now until September. Here's what we have &amp; have done so far.</div>
<div><strong>March -&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>Snow Canyon State Park</div>
<div>Zion National Park</div>
<div><strong>April -&nbsp;</strong><br />Arizona to visit friends and help with the Easter Pageant in Mesa</div>
<div><strong>May -</strong><br />
<div>
<div>Vegas for my friend Emily's wedding</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>California for my grandpa's 90th birthday<br />Camping in southern UT with a trailer from Salt Creek Imports</div>
<div>Idaho for Tony's mom - birthday celebration<br /><br /></div>
<div><strong>June -</strong></div>
<div>Hot Air Balloon Festival in Salina<br />
<div>
<div>Gem Mountain in&nbsp;Montana&nbsp;for our 3rd anniversary<em> (this was postponed from April bc of weather)</em></div>
</div>
</div>
<div><strong>July -&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>Denver trip</div>
<div><strong>August -&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>Flaming Gorge</div>
<div>Grand Tetons<br /><br />I would also like to visit <a href="http://www.visitutah.com/parks-monuments/mighty5/">The Mighty Five</a>&nbsp;, we have done 1 already - 4 more to go! Of course we have been to them all but not this year.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I am so stoked for our summer travel plans! We hope to get the tow hitch put on my car before our next trip. It'd be awesome to go to a teardrop camper meetup sometime this summer too, it all depends on where and when.&nbsp;</div>
<div>If anyone in UT (or close) reading this wants to meet up with us at any of these places , let me know and we can talk details. It'd be fun to have you come or meet up with us there!</div>
