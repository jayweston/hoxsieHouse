So excited to finally be able to check out Yellowstone. Tony went when he was a kid but I had never been before. 

We saw a really cool waterfall area

I love this picture of us

These are my favorite kinds of hikes...to a waterfall

Then we drove and saw some cool stuff

Waiting to see the big one! Old Faithful!

Yurts!
