The flowers on the temple grounds are always so pretty!

I had to stand across the street to fit everything in

Tony messed around taking some panoramic shots but instead of left and right he did from the ground to the sky. They actually turned out kind of cool.

Crazy cool tree I saw as we walked back to the car. Reminded me of Halloween

We made sure to stop at one of our favorite places to eat on our way out of St. George.

Stay tuned to see where we head next!
